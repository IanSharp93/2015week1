### Section 1: The Front End
#### Required - Answer these questions in the deliverables file, and complete the following. 
What is the role of HTML in a web page?    
HTML has been the standard for professional websites. It stands for Hypertext Markup Language and can be quite confusing to someone who has no experience using it. HTML is the language, or code, used to edit and position the text, images, frames and other web page elements.

What is the role of CSS in a web page?   
CSS was created to allow designers to have even more creativity and control over their designs. It is the other side of HTML, it allows us to change the design adn look of out code. It works together with HTML to creat a web design. CSS encourages less effort by allowing designers to create style sheets. It is one of the newer versions that works toegether with HTML helping to symplify it.   

What is the role of Javascript in a web page?   
JavaScript can make a website more interactive and it can also help in processing any information received from the websiteâ€™s visitors. It also helps to allow the designer of the website to guide the visitors through the website, from tab to tab and from page to page. It is a great way to design the webpage.

### Section 2: HTML and CSS 101

#### meta
Why do we separate HTML and CSS?  
The seperation between HTML and CSS is important becasue they each work to complete there own things, one is the foundation and the other is the structure adn the design. They work together to make the code and everything work in unison, although they need to be seperated becasue they are different entities. Each one has their own coding format and then they come together to make one site.     

#### HTML
What are classes and IDs (and how are they different)?  
ID's are unique, each element can only have one ID, it is like the finger print of the elements. It is the thing that determines what pieces you are using in the elements adn you can only have one of these ID's for everysingle element and page. A class is not a unique aspect because you can use the same class for multiple and many elements. Also we can use many classes on one individual element. They are different because and ID is unique to each element where the class can be seen in many different elements.

What are elements?  
An element is a single component of HTML Code, most elements are written with a start tag and an end tag, with the content in between. It is the framewrok of our HTML, where each element incorporates content into our HTML code.

What are tags?  
Tags surround content and give meaning to the content. There are opening and closing tags for all the content on the HTML work. 
What are attributes?  
An HTML attribute is a modifier of an HTML element. HTML attributes generally appear as name-value pairs. Attributes come after the tags and they help to describe the tags that they come after.   

What are forms?  
HTML Forms are one of the main points of interaction between a user and a web site or application. They allow users to send data to the web site. Most of the time that data is sent to the web server, but the web page can also intercept it to use it on its own. It is the setup of the website and you simply need a web browser and text editor to work wiht these forms.

What is a div?  
A div is a regular block-level element it simply begins the piece of information. It is more simple then a a or a p element which did convey some specific piece of command, it is the main layout or structure for setting up you web page in the HTML format.   

What are selectors?  
A selector is the thing that actually selects what you want to stylize in your CSS part of the program. Selecting different elements and allowing you to create and customize them in any way. It is used on the CSS side of the program to seperate the differnet pieces of design.   

What are properties?  
CSS properties are simply everything that you use to stylize and change the lay out of the webpage, it is somehtitng like the background-color or the font-family that you would like to give to a certain piece of code. It is everythinhg that makes your web page have character and uniqueness   

What are values?  
A value in CSS is what comes after your property, it is the color, or the size of the font. This is what you put in to complete your property, it is the other piece of the puzzle. It allows the designer to customize the program exactly how they would like it to look. 

How do CSS styles for a particular element get inherited? ie. how does an element get its "default" styles?   
These styles for many important elements are inhereted when a younger style gets the style directly from an older form of that style. It is a style property that is taken from an alternative style property for the same thing, meaning they are just unique forms of styles that are derived from one style that is already in existance.   

What are two CSS attributes you can change to push an element around on the page?  
There are many attributes that we can use to push elemets around on our page. One is wiht the float element; this goes inside the brackets of the CSS code. The float allows us to sssentially take an element, remove it from the normal flow of our page, and position it to the left or right of its parent element, where it was before. Secondly we can do move or push elements around with the inline-block which are helpful for laying out pages or for placing elements next to one another within a line. It is used in conjuction with the display property as is the float. The inline-block is good when we are creating alot of tabs or buttons on the screen in a row.      

What are the three different ways to include CSS in your project or use CSS to style a particular element?  
The three ways to include CSS in our projects is either in-line, internal, and external. In-line styles are placed directly into the HTML tags using the style attribute, the internal styles are used for the whole page, they go inside the head element and the style tags surround all of the styles for the page, and last but not least the external styles are used for the whole multiple-page website.

### Section 3: Git and Github  
What is Git?  
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It is important for tracking content such as files and directories, things like what we may be doing here with this git answering questions.

What is SCM?  
SMC stands for Software configuration management, which handles the task of tracking and controlling changes in the software,it is part of the larger cross-discipline field of configuration management. SMC's can also determine what was changed and who changed it in the software.   

What is a VCS?  
a VCS is a Version Control System which is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later on in the programing process. It allows us to change files back to a previous state, return the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, and lastly who introduced an issue into the program potentially.

Why is Git useful for a developer?  
Git is usful for developers because it is an easier way for them to submit commands adn write code online. It is the main place where we can put in our work. It is a place to put and develope projects that any developer may have.

Why is Git useful for a team of developers?  
It is useful for a team of developers because each team member can centralize they work in one place. The creation of the project can happen with many team members and they can all bring they work together and when it is time to finish the project all the cading adn commands are in one place.

How do you create a new Git repository for a project locally?  
The git inital command creates a new Git repository. We go into our terminal adn then open up sublime text and there we have already copied over the file to there we can start to make our changes to our project. 

How do you create it on Github?  
You will, once you have changed all the things on a text editor you will through your terminal, use git add and git push to send that project to the Github.

How do you commit changes?  
To commit your changes simply type git commit on the terminal and the git you just added will commit to the Github.

What is the difference between staging and committing changes?  
Stage to Commit would be for a file that already has changes being tracked which you've since altered. You would generally only "add" a file once to begin tracking changes, and thereafter you would simply stage the file for commit that you've changed.

What is the difference between committing your changes and pushing them to Github?  
A commit is a revision so to speak or an individual change to a file or set of files, tt's like when you save a file. Where pushing your changes will actually send all your finished work to a repository such as GitHub.com.

What is the command to check the status of your current repo in git?  
The command to check our status of our repo is git status

What is the command to see the history of your previous commits (from the command line)?  What are a few interesting variations (sets of options)?  
We can do this by looking up git log in our terminal.

How can you look through your historical commits on the Github website?  
We can look at our historica commits on the GitHub website through our issues button on the website.

What is a "Merge"?  
Merging takes the changes from one branch in the same repository or from a fork, and applies them into another.  

What is a "Pull Request"?  
Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators.

What is "Forking" a repo?  
Forking a repo is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original.  

What is "Cloning" a repo? 
Cloning a repo refers to making a copy of your repo on to your computer instead of the computers repositories.
